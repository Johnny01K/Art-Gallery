 - Art Gallery
 
 This is a project that I did for my university exercise of building a website. I chose an art theme as I am also an artist and wanted to have a website that can show a gallery of my artworks.
 
 You are able to preview my pictures and the idea is to be able to send a direct email of your art order to me via "contact" (order an existing artwork or a custom one that you want to be made), but is not possible as I don't know PHP.
 
 This was my first HTML/CSS/JS project and I was learning the languages along with it.
